## LOGIATIME

To install this library, you just need to run the following command:
```shell
go get github.com/yusologia/go-time
```

Instead of coding yourself to calculate time, it's better to just use logiatime.

Using it is very simple, just look at this example code ["example"](https://github.com/yusologia/go-time/tree/master/example/main.go).

We have also prepared several languages, and you only need to add the following code to your **.env**

```text
LOGIATIME_LANG=<language> // Ex: Indonesia
```

#### Here is the list of available languages:
- English
- Indonesian
- French
